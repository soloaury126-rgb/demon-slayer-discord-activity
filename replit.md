# Overview

This is a minimal Node.js application setup with Express.js as the web framework. The project appears to be in its initial stages, providing a basic foundation for building web applications or APIs. The repository contains only the essential package configuration files, indicating it's a starter template or boilerplate for Node.js development.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
- **Express.js**: Chosen as the primary web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Node.js Runtime**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution
- **Minimal Setup**: Clean, lightweight architecture without unnecessary dependencies

## Application Structure
- **Entry Point**: Configured to use `index.js` as the main application file
- **Package Management**: Uses npm with lock file for dependency version control
- **Development Approach**: Focused on simplicity and extensibility

## Design Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: Express.js selected for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive ecosystem
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal dependencies to reduce complexity and potential security vulnerabilities
- **Scalability Preparation**: Basic structure allows for easy extension with additional middleware, routes, and services

# External Dependencies

## Core Dependencies
- **Express.js (^4.18.2)**: Web application framework for Node.js
  - Includes standard middleware like body-parser for request parsing
  - Provides routing capabilities and HTTP utility methods

## Development Tools
- **npm**: Package manager for dependency installation and script execution
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment (version checking configured in start script)

## Notable Considerations
- No database dependencies currently configured
- No authentication or authorization libraries present
- No frontend framework or build tools included
- Ready for integration with additional services as needed
